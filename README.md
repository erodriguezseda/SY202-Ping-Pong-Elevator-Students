# SY202 Ping-Pong Elevator Project
This is part of USNA SY202 Project 1.
Date: March 2023
Students are asked to implement a logic controller, a proportional controller, and a proportional-integral controller on the ping-pong ball elevator project.


## Application functionality

The `main()` function is the single thread in the application. It toggles the state of a digital output connected to an LED on the board.

## Building and running

1. Connect a USB cable between the USB port on the board and the host computer.
2. <a name="build_cmd"></a> Run the following command to build the example project and program the microcontroller flash memory:
    ```bash
    $ mbed compile -m <TARGET> -t <TOOLCHAIN> --flash
    ```
The binary is located at `./BUILD/<TARGET>/<TOOLCHAIN>/mbed-os-example-blinky.bin`.

Alternatively, you can manually copy the binary to the board, which you mount on the host computer over USB.

Depending on the target, you can build the example project with the `GCC_ARM`, `ARM` or `IAR` toolchain. After installing Arm Mbed CLI, run the command below to determine which toolchain supports your target:

```bash
$ mbed compile -S
```

## Expected output
The LED on your target turns on and off every 500 milliseconds.


## Troubleshooting
If you have problems, you can review the [documentation](https://os.mbed.com/docs/latest/tutorials/debugging.html) for suggestions on what could be wrong and how to fix it.
